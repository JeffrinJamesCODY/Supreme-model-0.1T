# Supreme-model-0.1T
Building, working and practicing on creating AI-Models using frameworks such as PyTorch on CPU Usage.
Hey there! I am currently practicing building AI-models, you are free to give any suggestions and recommendations about this Supreme-model-0.1T. 
Supreme Models would get updated by time with releases, Supreme Model are would be released in one category which is TUNE. This model is currently 0.1T(T for Tune)
These models would get better over-time slowly and gradualy, the best thing is that developers can get involved into working on Supreme Models because it's an Open-Source Project.
